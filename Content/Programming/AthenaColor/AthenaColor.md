# AthenaColor
A Python package which allows for commonly used HTML color names to be printed to the console (permitting the console can take advantage of rgb ANSI codes).

Made by Andreas Sas 2022, during his [[Directive Athena]] project. Andreas started work on this smaller project out of sheer spite of using as little third party tools, libraries and other things, as possible.
