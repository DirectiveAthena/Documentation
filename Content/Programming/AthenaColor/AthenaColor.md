# AthenaColor
A Python package which allows for commonly used HTML color names to be printed to the console (permitting the console can take advantage of rgb ANSI codes).

Made by [[Andreas Sas]] 2022, during his [[Directive Athena]] project. Andreas started work on this smaller project out of sheer spite of using as little third party tools, libraries and other things, as possible. 
> "To be fair, making my own color printer, might not have been the best use of my time"
~ Andreas Sas 2022 - While on vacation in Yorkshire

Currently supported Python versions: **3.7**, **3.8**, **3.9**, **3.10**
**Source Code:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DirectiveAthena/VerSC-AthenaColor)

Other older versions of Python are not currently supported. These older versions will probably not be supported by Andreas Sas himself, but if you want to contribute to the project and make this package compatible with older versions of Python, Pull requests are always welcome.
