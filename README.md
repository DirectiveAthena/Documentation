# Directive Athena - Full project documentation
This is the full documentation of everything involving the Directive Athena project. Currently it holds the following sections:

- **Daily Notes** : I try to write daily notes on my day to take care of myself and track how I'm doing and feeling
- **Documentation** : Holds all documentation files for the various programming projects I'm doing.
- **Info** : A more "general" section for random information that isn't tied to anything specific
- **ToDo** : Holds all to-do lists I have setup for myself. The base to-do files are written using the obsidian [kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) plugin. They will work like normal markdown files in your local copy or the obsidian publish website without this plugin.

The project is made by Andreas Sas and is in continuous development.
