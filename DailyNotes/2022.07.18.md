## Notes

So, I couldn't really wake up at 6 am, but that is okay. These days the temperatures in Belgium are becoming quite a lot to bare for me, and I need all the rest I can get.
I don't really have something set out for today to do. Maybe that is a good thing? I need time to come up with my ideas and plan them out accordingly.
