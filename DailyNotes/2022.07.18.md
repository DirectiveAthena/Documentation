## Notes

**12.00** : 
So, I couldn't really wake up at 6 am, but that is okay. These days the temperatures in Belgium are becoming quite a lot to bare for me, and I need all the rest I can get.
I don't really have something set out for today to do. Maybe that is a good thing? I need time to come up with my ideas and plan them out accordingly and sometimes I just need a little bit of time to come up with them.

**14.33** :
Yeah... So today isn't going that well.
I can't get motivated to start doing anything and that is really bumming me out. I just need to get started on something, but for some reason I just can't ... I don't know what to do
