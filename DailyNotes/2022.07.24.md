## Notes
**14:20** :
This morning was very fun walking around the small sea town here with the girlfriend. Fun note, she went around three bakeries to find a small piece of strawberry cake which saw in the first one, but didn't get it the first time we went to that bakery and by the time we came back to the first one, that specific type of cake was nowhere to be seen haha. Oh well, I eventually bought another type of cake for her and she was very happy with it.
Now we are driving back to Antwerp and hopefully I'll be able to work a little bit more at home before the day is over, but no pressure.

**21:15** :
After coming home I got to work, applying the same project cleanups I did on the weekend (aka, on my laptop) to my desktop. God was that a bit of work. Some stuff went better than others, but overall it went kind of okay.
Now, the server... So I had a server, which broke a couple of weeks ago. As in, the old motherboard gave out and replacing the 8+ year old hardware isn't worth it. So I decided to replace it. (only took me about a month to replace a piece of hardware I really need for the project, better than my 6+ month average).
