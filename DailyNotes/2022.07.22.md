## Notes
**07:43** : 
Just forced myself to wake up... boy have I forgotten how hard it is to wake up without my coffee I have every morning. Oh well, can't always rely on 3rd party chemicals to wake me up.

**11:33** : 
Ahh, just had my first coffee for the day! God I love Coffee... I might have a coffee problem ... I know, but oh well, a few 3rd party dependencies is fine, right?

**18:17** : 
Back at the family place, and am glad I can work again haha.
I sometimes wonder if it truly is a good thing I'm feeling this joy and fullness when I work on the project, or if it is more of a hurdle when I'm not working on it.
