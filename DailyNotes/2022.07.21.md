## Notes
**21:48** :
So today started out a little bit iffy, but all in all I can't complain too much as I got a lot of work done on reworking my repo's on GitHub to a stable stte again. All branches that had already been merged, or were still waiting for their merge have been merged.
It feels good to have done such a cleanup
