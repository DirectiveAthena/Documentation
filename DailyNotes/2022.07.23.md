## Notes
**08:26** :
So... I woke up at 6, then again at 7 and now again at 8... what even is the point of having an alarm anymore haha

**11:29** :
Phew, finally added all the CSS classes I currently wanted to this obsidian vault. Isn't much as of today, but the bare minimum is there. The headers all have a slightly different makeup and the various packages all have different gradients for the H1 header. I'm not planning on adding these gradients to the other header levels, as it would get unsightly very quickly I think. For static colours I have done this, as it feels to be less intrusive

**22:14** : 
Just spent the day with my dad on his birthday and it was really awesome! We walked down the beach chatted a whole lot and had a great deal of fun with the family. I have to say, although I'm quite the hermit, spending time with them is fun.
Anyways, tomorrow I'll be going home again and I am really looking forward to soling all the problems I've created for myself by organizing all my GitHub repos into a format that works for me.
Oh god, what fun/horror that will be.
Anyways, I'm going to keep working a little bit before I go to bed, but I don't know if I'll write anything anymore, so see you guys tomorrow.
