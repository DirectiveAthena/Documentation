## Notes
**23.05** :

I can't really say today was a wonderful day... I wasn't able to do anything for the project which is kinda iffy. 
I really don't like going on vacations as it forces me to slow down, without my own input. I do like going on vacations when it is me (or me together with the girlfriend, but that is a given) deciding when and how, but foing with a 3rd party always feels off for me. 
When I try to work in the evening I always feel like I shouldnt as it "ruins the mood". I cant help it that I get a lot of gratification from working on my project and when I dont work on it I feel more and more depressed the less I work on it. That is one of the major problems I have, when I cant work I get more and more in a downwards cycle. I know that is one of my pain points, but I cant do without it really.
Anyways, I hope I can get a bit of work done in this place. See you all tomorrow !
