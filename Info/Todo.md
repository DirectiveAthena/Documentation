# *Non Linear* Todo
Because [[Andreas Sas|Andreas]] his brain is quite stupid, he can't make a simple structured list from A to Z, he decided to just listen to his brain and make a list which made sense to him. A "non linear todo list", which means the overall structure of the list doesn't correspond with a set order to follow, but more of a guideline to what needs to be done in an overall manner.
